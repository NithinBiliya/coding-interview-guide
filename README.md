1. [Linked List](#linked-list)


=======================================================

## Linked List
Node - container contains a data part and a link part.

a. Singly linked list - only one pointer in a node pointing to the next node

a.a. head pointer - only one pointer pointing to the first node of the linked list. (points to null if empty)

a.b. head and tail pointer - head pointer points to the first node while the tail pointer points to the last node (both points to null if empty)

b. Doubly linked list - two pointers in a node. one pointing to the next node while the other pointing to the previous node

c. Circular linked list - the last node in the linked list points to the first node in the list
