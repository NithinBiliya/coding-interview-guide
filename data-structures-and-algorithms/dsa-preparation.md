DS and algo
============

1. f(n)=f(n-1)*f(n-2); f(0) and f(1) are inputs to the function (dynamic). Find the number of 0's in f(n).

2. Ascending string rotated few times. Find the minimum element with less than n complexity

3. Substring of a string in less than m*n complexity

4. Array of random positive and negative numbers. Equal number of positive and negative numbers. Rearrange such that the even index will have positive and odd index negative elements. Space complexity of n and time complexity of less than n^2

5. Get largest consecutive sub array
Input - 2 0 2 1 4 3 4 1
Output - 0 2 1 4 3

6. how to find cycle/loop in a linked list with n complexity

7. Compare 2 binary trees for equality

8. Solving Sudoku game

9. Validating already solved Sudoku game

10. implementing queues using stack (we need 2 stacks for it)

11. Load balancing question and it's complexity. Find minimum time to load balance. Array of server loads is given. 
Eg. Ip- 0,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. 10 servers with below. Minimum time taken is 7sec. 
1st sec - 0,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
2nd sec - 1,1,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0 etc

12. Given a number, find the floor or square root of the number

13. Rain drop problem - given an array containing height of 2D walls, find how many units of water can be stored in it if it rains.

14. vertical printing of the nodes in a binary trees

15. rotating a linked list by n nodes

16. Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2 while there are repetitions for all of them. Sort the array with O(n) time complexity.

17. Given a string you have to partition the string in such a manner that each part of the partitioned string is a palindrome in itself and you have to count the number of such partition
For eg: given string NITIN
N ITI N
N I T I N
NITIN 
So output will be 3.

18. You are given with a large paragraph and N words.
You have to find a min length subparagraph of the paragraph which contain all those N words in any order. Here length of a paragraph is the count of words in the paragraph.

19. find 2 largest elements in an array in O(n).

20. add binary numbers represented in string

21. There is a biased function which gives only 0 for a coin flip. Write a function using existing biased fucntion which gives and unbiased result. What is the biased coin toss returned 1 with 60% probability and 40% with 0 probability.

22. find all the heavy paths in a binary tree where heavy means sum of all the nodes from root to leaf should be greater than a threshold.

23. A string consists of ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘?’. The question mark can be either ‘0’ or ‘1’. Find all possible combinations for a string.’ (not just the number of combinations)
